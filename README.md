- Score keeping
- Automatic replay
- Randomly generated mazes

## Description

CamelTrouble is an Ocaml implementation of [TankTrouble](https://tanktrouble.com/). It involves random maze generation, random player spawn locations/orientation, and the ability for both players to move via keyboard inputs. The players can shoot a max of 5 balls, and all of the balls and the camels can demonstrate collisions with walls. Balls move dynamically and ricochet around the maze, before expiring after a period of time. If any ball collides with a camel player, then the game ends and players have the option to replay. After we encompassed the functionality of the original game, we added more features to improve user experiences. This led us to implement start/end screens, player personalization, and sound effects.
