In order to install:

opam install Graphics
opam install js_of_ocaml
opam install js_of_ocaml-lwt

Then run: 

1. make build (to recompile main.js)
2. run index.html for the game (we ran on VSCode Live Server)

Instructions for gameplay: 
1. Input names of player 1 and player 2 (then deselect text area)
2. Press ENTER 
3.  player 1: WASD and E for shooting 
    player 2: arrow keys and period for shooting

NOTE:
We encountered difficulty installing Graphics on different devices. Some advice from our
experience: 
- on Mac or Linux, you may need XQuartz/11 or the equivalent package for Linux. 
- Graphics depends on OpenGL (or 'gloo') -> you can check if Graphics has been properly
installed by attempting to load the 'graphics.cma' file in utop. Gloo may have
to be installed. 

In addition, if you get an error that it cannot find main.byte --> look for it in the _build
folder and move it to the main directory. Chmod 0755 ./main.byte and it should work.
If the main.byte file is not there, run make play and it should appear.
